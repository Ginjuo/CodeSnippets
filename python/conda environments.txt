To copy your anaconda environment from one machine to another, open anaconda prompt and write:
conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

Copy the file to the receiving machine, and write:
conda env create -f environment.yml

You can reinstall an environment with the following (in case an error occured in the first run):
conda env update -f environment.yml

But I recommend deleting the environment and creating the environment from scratch
conda env remove --name myEnvironment
